# Analysing PostgreSQL Data in R

This repository contains code and instructions for connecting to a PostgreSQL database and performing data analysis using R, as explained in the [article by Linus Chirchir](https://linuschirchir.medium.com/analysing-postgresql-data-in-r-1234567890).

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database from R and perform data analysis using popular R packages like “DBI”, “RPostgres”, and “dplyr”. The repository includes example scripts that guide you through querying data and conducting basic analysis, making it a useful resource for data scientists and analysts who work with PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- R (version 3.6 or later)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended for ease of use)
- PostgreSQL database (local or remote)
- Necessary R packages: “DBI”, “RPostgres”, and “dplyr”

## Installation

First, install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("DBI", "RPostgres", "dplyr"))
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuschirchir/Analysing-PostgreSQL-Data-in-R.git
cd Analysing-PostgreSQL-Data-in-R
```

## Connecting to PostgreSQL

The main script for connecting to the PostgreSQL database is included in the `connect_to_db.R` file. You can run this script in your R environment:

```r
source("connect_to_db.R")
```

This script sets up a connection to your PostgreSQL database, allowing you to execute SQL queries directly from R.

## Querying and Analysing Data

Once connected, you can use the `query_and_analyse. R` script to retrieve and analyse data. This script demonstrates how to:

- Write and execute SQL queries in R
- Manipulate and analyse the retrieved data using `dplyr`
- Visualize results with basic plotting functions

Run the script as follows:

```r
source("query_and_analyse. R")
```

## Customisation

Feel free to customize the scripts to suit your needs:

- SQL Queries: Modify the SQL queries in the scripts to retrieve different data or perform more complex operations.
- Analysis Techniques: Add or change the analysis techniques using other R packages or custom functions.
- Visualizations: Incorporate more advanced visualizations using packages like `ggplot2` or `plotly`.
