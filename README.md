# Analysing PostgreSQL Data in R

This repository contains R scripts demonstrating how to connect R to a PostgreSQL database using the RPostgreSQL package. It covers essential steps like setting up the connection, listing database tables, executing SQL queries, and performing operations such as INNER JOINs. It also includes examples of how to extract and analyse data and how to properly close the database connection when you're done. This code is designed to help you easily replicate the steps from my tutorial in your own environment. You can read the article on Medium on the link provided.
